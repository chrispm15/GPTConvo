# GPT-3.5 Self Conversation

A quick experiment where GPT-3.5 talks to itself to see how well it can reason, ask questions, and sustain an interesting conversation without human input.

### How It Works
- Starts with a **system** and **user** prompt  
- Each response becomes the next input  
- Runs for 10 total exchanges  

### Run It
```bash
python self_conversation.py
